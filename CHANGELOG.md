This repo is customized for www.mattorb.com

GitHub Action / Muffet Broken Link Checker settings to support that:
* Skip validating linkedin/twitter links
* Skip validating one graphql page that uses 'name' for anchor frag link instead of id - not best but browser allows it
* Exclude validating github link back to workflow
